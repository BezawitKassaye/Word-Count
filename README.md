# Word-Count
The class AVLTreeUnique is a subclass of AVLTree (from class).
The function word count() creates an AVL tree representing the frequency distribution of the words in the input file. That is, each word in the file is a key, and the keyâ€™s value is the number of times the corresponding word appears in the file. 
The function report() writes the words and frequencies in descending order of frequency to the file report.txt.
The function display_common() prints a human-readable sorted list of the n most common words in the AVL tree, in descending order of frequency.
